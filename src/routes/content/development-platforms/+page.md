In this course, we will delve into the essential concepts and building blocks that power the rapidly evolving development tooling industry. We will explore a variety of tools and technologies that are used to scale and automate different aspects of the development process, from traditional databases to cutting-edge AI tools. However, due to the dynamic nature of this field, it is impossible to cover specific tools in great depth. The industry is constantly evolving, with new tools and technologies emerging and others becoming obsolete quickly. This is why small companies with limited resources can become wildly popular within a few months, and successful products can vanish just as rapidly. Both the course material and the assignments have been designed with this reality in mind.
